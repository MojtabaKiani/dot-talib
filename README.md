# Technical Analysis Library in C#

This is my second try to implement technical indicators. I've done it in  [Elixir](https://github.com/benyblack/talib) before.
The aim of the project is to be used in different scenarios like back-testing and automated trading.

This is list of implemented indicators:
- [x] MA (EMA, SMA)
- [x] RSI
- [x] MACD
- [x] Stochastic

At the moment there are somethings to be done before it gets ready for use in production. And it needs some refactors and optimization like memoization.
